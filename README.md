# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Customer Churn Prediction** model using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data such as credit score, account balance, and more.

## Key Features
- **Churn Prediction**: The model predicts the likelihood of customer churn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical encoding, scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Modeling**: Implemented with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow.
- **Streamlit Application**: The model is deployed with Streamlit for easy prediction and testing.
